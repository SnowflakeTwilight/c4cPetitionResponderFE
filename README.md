Receive high volumes of online petition signups and support messages.

Miss out on engagement opportunities with potential volunteers, donors, or supporters.

Have no simple way to categorize or route petition data for real-world action.

This causes:

Delays in building trust with petitioners.

Disconnected supporter journeys.

Missed chances for grassroots mobilization and impact.
